<p><em>People got addicted and made some crazy setups. This one's from Isolation 1.</em>  </p>

<p>This was a very fun project!<br />
I made this around the start of 2024 on <a href="https://mcdiamondfire.com">DiamondFire</a>. This project was intended<br />
to be very small, but when I released it, people loved it. On its first day, the game had a peak player count of <strong>74</strong>!<br />
I don't have evidence of it going up to 72, but I do have this:  </p>

<p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
If you look at the player list, there are some interesting faces here:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Luke583</strong> - One of Isolation's beta testers before release  </li>
<li><strong>wodozar</strong> - Isolation 1's texture pack maker  </li>
<li><strong>IcyBlizzardPengu, Hi_Tale</strong> - People I am friends with that I met through this project!  </li>
<li><strong>NotWizaro, VoidicStar</strong> - These people ended up becoming top players later on  </li>
<li><strong>Henry118EP</strong> - Ended up becoming one of Isolation 1 &amp; 2's builders  </li>
</ul>

<p>And as a fun tidbit, when I banned someone for abusing dupe glitches without reporting them, I got this message back:  </p>

<p><img src="../img/iso2.png" alt="Ban Message" />  </p>

<p>I did not accept this deal. I believe that is actually against DiamondFire's rules.  </p>

<p>I gave the game about <strong>14</strong> updates before I stopped working on it.  </p>

<h3>Why did I stop working on it?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, DiamondFire code is <em>very</em> difficult to scale up.  </p>

<p><img src="../img/iso4.png" alt="DiamondFire Coding" />  </p>

<p>On DiamondFire, it's very easy to advertise and get players, which is why I use it. But the coding system is very<br />
esoteric. Everything is in Minecraft's blocks and item system. This makes small projects easy to make, but once you<br />
scale them up to make an open-world RPG, for example, you can run into trouble with code space and organization.  </p>

<p>This isn't even mentioning DiamondFire's lack of an OOP system, meaning you have to use Dictionaries to emulate those<br />
(which wastes even more code space). I have my own gripes with its coding system, but I'll leave that for another time.<br />
I still like using it despite its flaws.</p>
