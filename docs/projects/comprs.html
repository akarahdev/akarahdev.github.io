This is a calculator I'm developing as of this moment!
While a calculator like this seems like a very simple project, there is a lot of trickiness with this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complex number support</li>
<li>Performant graphing & expression computation</li>
<li>Custom node & expression tree system in egui</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
Right now it's very barebones, with little support for more complex things like vectors,
but there will be more support soon!
<br>
A web demo will be available eventually when I figure out how to port this to WASM.
<br>
You can view the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/akarahdev/comp-rs">https://github.com/akarahdev/comp-rs</a>
<br>
Note the source code repository is very barebones as of this moment, I will make it look better soon!</p>
