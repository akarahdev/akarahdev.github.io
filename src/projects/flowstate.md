## Flow State

![Flow state game preview image](../img/fs1.png)

This is **Flow State**!  
It's a really fast-paced parkour game, with lots of tricks and mechanics. For example, on **Prismarine**,  
you cannot stop sprinting, or you will have to restart.  

At the end is a structure called **The Gauntlet**.

It's a massive parkour gauntlet with **no** checkpoints. Only one player has beaten it thus far: **IcyBlizzardPengu**.  

The gameâ€™s not breaking many records unlike *Isolation*, but it is considered very fun!
