<br>
This is Flow State!<br>
It's a really fast-paced parkour game, with lots of tricks and mechanics. For example, on <b>Prismarine</b>,
you can not stop sprinting or you will have to restart.<br>
<br>
At the end is a structure called <b>The Gauntlet</b>.<br>

It's a massive parkour gauntlet with <b>no</b> checkpoints. Only 1 player has beat it thus far, <b>IcyBlizzardPengu</b>.

The game's not breaking many records unlike Isolation, but it is considered very fun!
