    <h3>Isolation & Isolation 2</h3>
    <img src="img/iso1.png"><br>

    <i>People got addicted and made some crazy setups. This one's from Isolation 1.</i><br><br>

    This was a very fun project!<br>
    I made this around the start of 2024 on <a href="https://mcdiamondfire.com">DiamondFire</a>. This project was intended
    to be very small, but when I released it, people loved it. On it's first day, the game had a peak player count of 74!
    I don't have evidence of it going up to 72, but I do have this:<br>
    <img src="img/iso3.png" style="height: 20%; width: 20%"><br>

    <b>Did you know?</b>
    If you look at the player list, there are some interesting faces here:<br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Luke583</b> - One of Isolation's beta testers before release</li>
        <li><b>wodozar</b> - Isolation 1's texture pack maker</li>
        <li><b>IcyBlizzardPengu, Hi_Tale</b> - People I am friends with that I met through this project!</li>
        <li><b>NotWizaro, VoidicStar</b> - These people ended up becoming top players later on</li>
        <li><b>Henry118EP</b> - Ended up becoming one of Isolation 1 & 2's builders</li>
    </ul>

    And as a fun tidbit, when I banned someone for abusing dupe glitches without reporting them, I got this message back:<br>
    <img src="img/iso2.png"><br>
    I did not accept this deal. I believe that is actually against DiamondFire's rules.<br>

    I gave the game about <b>14</b> updates before I stopped working on it.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Why did I stop working on it?</b><br>
    Unfortunately, DiamondFire code is <i>very</i> difficult to scale up.<br>
    <img src="img/iso4.png"><br>
    On DiamondFire, it's very easy to advertise and get players, which is why I use it. But the coding system is very
    esoteric. Everything is in Minecraft's blocks and item system. This makes small projects easy to make, but once you
    scale them up to make a open-world RPG for example, you can run into trouble with code space and organization.<br><br>
    This isn't even mentioning DiamondFire's lack of OOP system, meaning you have to use Dictionaries to emulate those
    (which wastes even more codespace). I have my own gripes with it's coding system, but I'll leave that for another times.
    I still like using it despite it's flaws.

    <h2>Flow State</h2>
    <img src="img/fs1.png" alt="Flow state game preview image">
    <br>
    This is Flow State!<br>
    It's a really fast-paced parkour game, with lots of tricks and mechanics. For example, on <b>Prismarine</b>,
    you can not stop sprinting or you will have to restart.<br>
    <br>
    At the end is a structure called <b>The Gauntlet</b>.<br>
    <img src="img/fs2.png"><br>
    It's a massive parkour gauntlet with <b>no</b> checkpoints. Only 1 player has beat it thus far, <b>IcyBlizzardPengu</b>.

    The game's not breaking many records unlike Isolation, but it is considered very fun!

    <h2>Comp-RS [placeholder name]</h2>
    <img src="img/calc1.png">
    <br>
    This is a calculator I'm developing as of this moment!
    While a calculator like this seems like a very simple project, there is a lot of trickiness with this one:
    <ul>
        <li>Complex number support</li>
        <li>Performant graphing & expression computation</li>
        <li>Custom node & expression tree system in egui</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Right now it's very barebones, with little support for more complex things like vectors,
    but there will be more support soon!
    <br>
    A web demo will be available eventually when I figure out how to port this to WASM.
    <br>
    You can view the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/akarahdev/comp-rs">https://github.com/akarahdev/comp-rs</a>
    <br>
    Note the source code repository is very barebones as of this moment, I will make it look better soon!
